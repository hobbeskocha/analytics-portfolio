# Ayush Shrestha's Analytics Portfolio

## About Me

Hello, I'm Ayush Shrestha!

Welcome to my personal portfolio, where I showcase key personal projects that reflect my journey from software engineering into the exciting field of analytics and data science.

I hold a Master of Science in Business Analytics from the University of Washington, where I gained expertise in data science and analytics methodologies. My academic experience and hands-on projects have given me proficiency in supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning algorithms using Python, statistical modeling with Python & R, and data visualization using tools such as Tableau, Power BI, & various Python libraries. I have further communicated business insights derived from data to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, such as data scientists, data analysts, and product managers. I am eager to leverage these skills, alongside my analytical mindset and attention to detail, to solve complex business challenges through data analysis.

Additionally, I hold a Bachelor of Commerce in Business and Computer Science from the University of British Columbia, where I built a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, data structures & algorithms, and database management. With over two years of professional experience in software engineering, I bring a high level of competence in code development, testing, and optimization - skills that I am confident will enhance my effectiveness as an analyst and data scientist.

Outside of my professional interests, I am a dedicated weightlifter with over a decade of experience, video game enthusiast for 15 years, and proud cat dad to my two boys, Pooky and Hobbes.
