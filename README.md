# Ayush Shrestha's Analytics Portfolio

## A Journey from Software Engineering to Analytics

Hello, I'm Ayush Shrestha!

Welcome to my personal portfolio, featuring key personal and academic projects as I transition from software engineering to the dynamic field of analytics and data science.

I hold a Master of Science in Business Analytics from the University of Washington, where I developed expertise in data science methodologies. Through hands-on projects, I gained proficiency in supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning algorithms using Python and R, as well as data visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, and various Python libraries. Additionally, I have presented data-driven business insights to technical and non-technical stakeholders, including data scientists, analysts, and product managers. Leveraging these skills, I look forward to solving complex business challenges through data analysis.

I also hold a Bachelor of Commerce in Business and Computer Science from the University of British Columbia, where I built a solid foundation in data structures, algorithms, database management, and object-oriented programming. With over two years of experience in software engineering, I bring strong competencies in code development, testing, and optimization - skills that I am confident will enhance my effectiveness as an analyst and data scientist.

### Optimizing a Winery’s Marketing Communications Strategy

<img src="artifacts/winery.png" width=350 height=350>

**Link**: [Winery and You](https://github.com/hobbeskocha/winery-and-you)

**Goal**: 
Develop predictive models that identify the key factors driving customer subscription preferences across three marketing channels: email, newsletter, and direct calls.

**Description**:
In this project, we analyzed a winery's sales data of over 65,000 records from across the United States. We performed data cleaning and feature transformation on the dataset, followed by exploratory data analysis in Tableau. Logistic regression and random forest models were then trained to predict customer preferences. The coefficients and feature importances were examined to pinpoint the critical attributes influencing the likelihood of subscription.

**Results**:
The models revealed strong performance for email and direct call predictions, with accuracies above 85%, along with significant cross-channel marketing effects. Key recommendations included enhancing cross-channel promotions by increasing call engagement and expanding email marketing campaigns to boost customer loyalty and marketing ROI for the winery. 

**Tech Stack**:
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau

### Improving Customer Retention for Netflix

**Link**: [Netflix Retention](https://github.com/hobbeskocha/netflix-retention)

**Goal**: 
Identify the customer segments with a higher risk of churn to improve overall retention.

**Description**:
This project analyzes a synthetic dataset of approximately 2,500 customers to assist Netflix in refining its customer retention strategies. After performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using MySQL, key retention trends were visualized in Power BI, revealing the impact of customer tenure, preferred device type, age, and geography.

**Results**:
The analysis identified North American customers aged 41-50, who exhibited a 5% lower retention rate compared to their peers, as a high-risk segment prone to churn. To address the retention gap, recommendations included enhancing the user experience for family viewing and curating nostalgia-driven "must-watch" playlists for this demographic. By leveraging these insights, Netflix can more effectively tailor its marketing, content, and platform features to increase engagement and reduce churn in this critical customer segment.

**Tech Stack**: SQL (MySQL), Power BI

### Enhancing Salesforce’s Customer Engagement - Capstone Project

<img src="artifacts/blue-cloud.png" width=350 height=350>

**Goal**: 
Identify the key performance indicators driving high levels of customer engagement.

**Description**:
During a 10-week consulting engagement with Salesforce's Data & Analytics team as part of the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the University of Washington, our team of 8 conducted exploratory data analysis on over 1 million customer engagement records spanning 14 months. Using Pandas, Tableau, and Excel, customers were segmented into high, medium, and low engagement groups, and the top 5 out of 24 metrics driving engagement were identified. Additionally, trend analysis in Tableau tracked changes in engagement levels across these segments.

**Results**:
I lead the 8-person team to present our findings and business strategies in-person to 7 senior data scientists and analysts, contributing to future engagement-enhancing campaigns at Salesforce. Recommendations included

**Note**:
Due to the nature of this consulting engagement with Salesforce, I am under an NDA and cannot share the actual code or visualizations from the project.

**Tech Stack**:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly Express), Tableau, Excel

### Predicting Electricity Load with a Recurrent Neural Network - In Progress

<img src="artifacts/electricity.png" width=350 height=350>

**Link**: [NYC RNN](https://github.com/hobbeskocha/nyc-rnn)

**Goal**:
Forecast future load demand to optimize supply-side management.

**Description**:
In this work-in-progress project, I am developing a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to predict electricity load for New York City for 2024 using historical load data from 2021 to 2023. The project involves preprocessing and analyzing hourly electricity load data from 2021 to 2023 as the training set, which includes handling missing values and normalizing the data. I am employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal dependencies and achieve accurate predictions.

**Current Status**:
The data processing phase is complete. The network model has been defined with a training loop to identify the optimum weights and a validation loop to calculate the validation error. 

**Next Steps**:
Investigate incorporating weather data to enhance models' predictive power. Compare the LSTM models predictive power to more traditional time-series forecasting models, like SARIMA or Winters.

**Tech Stack**:
Python (Pandas, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
