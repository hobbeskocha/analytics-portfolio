# Ayush Shrestha's Analytics Portfolio

## About Me

Hello, I'm Ayush Shrestha!

Welcome to my personal portfolio, where I showcase key personal and academic projects that reflect my journey from software engineering into the exciting field of analytics and data science. I am currently pivoting my career into analytics full-time, and am actively searching for analyst and data science roles.

I hold a Master of Science in Business Analytics from the University of Washington, where I gained expertise in data science and analytics methodologies. My academic experience and hands-on projects have given me proficiency in supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning algorithms using Python, statistical modeling with Python & R, and data visualization using tools such as Tableau, Power BI, & various Python libraries. I have further communicated business insights derived from data to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, such as data scientists, data analysts, and product managers. I am eager to leverage these skills, alongside my analytical mindset and attention to detail, to solve complex business challenges through data analysis.

Additionally, I hold a Bachelor of Commerce in Business and Computer Science from the University of British Columbia, where I built a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, data structures & algorithms, and database management. With over two years of professional experience in software engineering, I bring a high level of competence in code development, testing, and optimization - skills that I am confident will enhance my effectiveness as an analyst and data scientist.

Outside of my professional interests, I am a dedicated weightlifter with over a decade of experience, video game enthusiast for 15 years, and proud cat dad to my two boys, Pooky and Hobbes.

## Projects

### Optimizing a Winery’s Marketing Communications Strategy

**Link**: [Winery and You](https://github.com/hobbeskocha/winery-and-you)

**Description**:
This project focuses on enabling a winery to enhance customer engagement through data-driven strategies by analyzing sales data from over 65,000 records across the United States. The primary objective was to develop predictive models that identify the key factors driving customer subscription preferences across three marketing channels: email, newsletter, and direct calls. After cleaning and transforming the dataset using Python and conducting exploratory analysis in Tableau, logistic regression and random forest models were trained to predict customer preferences. The coefficients and feature importances were then analyzed to identify the critical attributes affecting the likelihood of subscription.

**Results**:
The models revealed strong performance for email and direct call predictions, as well as highlighting significant cross-channel marketing effects. Key recommendations included leveraging cross-channel promotions, enhancing call engagement, and improving email campaigns, all aimed at boosting customer loyalty and increasing revenue for the winery.

**Tech Stack**:
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau

### Improving Customer Retention for Netflix

**Link**: [Netflix Retention](https://github.com/hobbeskocha/netflix-retention)

**Description**:
This project analyzes a synthetic dataset of approximately 2,500 customers to help Netflix refine its customer retention strategies. After conducting data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using MySQL, key retention trends were visualized in Power BI, highlighting the impact of customer tenure, preferred device type, age, and geography. The analysis identified high-risk segments prone to churn, with a particular emphasis on North American customers aged 41-50, who show a 5% lower retention rate compared to their peers.

**Results**:
To address the retention gap, recommendations included enhancing the user experience for family viewing and curating nostalgia-driven must-watch playlists for this demographic. By leveraging these insights, Netflix can better tailor its marketing, content, and platform features to boost engagement and reduce churn in this critical customer segment.

**Tech Stack**: SQL (MySQL), Power BI

### Enhancing Salesforce’s Customer Engagement - Capstone Project

<img src="artifacts/blue-cloud.png" width=350 height=350>

**Description**:
During a 10-week consulting engagement with Salesforce's Data & Analytics team as part of the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the University of Washington, exploratory data analysis was conducted on over 1 million customer engagement records spanning 14 months. Utilizing tools like Pandas, Tableau, and Excel, customers were segmented into high, medium, and low engagement groups and the top 5 out of 24 metrics driving engagement were identified. Additionally, trend analysis was performed in Tableau to track changes in engagement levels across these segments.

**Results**:
Leading an 8-person team, I presented our findings and business strategies in-person to 7 senior data scientists and analysts, contributing to future engagement-enhancing campaigns at Salesforce.

Due to this being a consulting engagement with Salesforce, I am under an NDA and cannot share actual code and visualizations from the project.

**Tech Stack**:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly Express), Tableau, Excel
